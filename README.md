## What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a method used to encode text characters as sequences of dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`). It was developed in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for use in long-distance telegraph communication.

## History of Morse Code

Morse code was first used in 1844 when Samuel Morse sent the message **“What hath God wrought”** from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore. It became a vital tool in maritime communication and during both World Wars.

## How Morse Code Works

Each letter and number is represented by a unique combination of dots and dashes. These can be transmitted through sound, light, or visual signals.

### Example Table

| Character | Morse Code |
|-----------|------------|
| A         | .-         |
| B         | -...       |
| C         | -.-.       |
| 1         | .----      |
| 2         | ..---      |

### Example Translations

- **HELLO** → `.... . .-.. .-.. ---`
- **SOS** → `... --- ...`
